# Hue lights off
Do you have the same problem as me ? You have your philips hue lights sync to your pc, 
and when you shutdown your pc you have to manually switch of your lights ? 

Well I had that "problem" to, that is why I created this simple Python script. When configures and added to your shutdown task your lights are turned off.
